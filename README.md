# TARGET MARKETING
-- Customers are segmented by RFM Analysis (RFM is a method used for analyzing customer value):

It groups customers based on their transaction history :

Recency — How many days ago was their last purchase?

Frequency — How many times has the customer purchased from our store?  

Monetary — How much do they spend?

The better you understand your target market, the more you’ll be able to focus your ads and reach the audience most likely to convert into customers.
