# customer_optimization
-- Customers are segmented by RFM Analysis (RFM is a method used for analyzing customer value):

It groups customers based on their transaction history :
Recency — How many days ago was their last purchase?
Frequency — How many times has the customer purchased from our store?  
Monetary — How much do they spend?
